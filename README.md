YODA - Yet another OCaml Documentation Authoring tool
=====================================================
“Always pass on what you have learned.” - Yoda 

YODA is an ocamldoc replacement(-ish) designed with more in mind
than simple documentation. It's intended to be a full-featured
processor for literate programming, although it will be more
than suited to handling normal documentation tasks. The tool is
driven by [Pandoc](https://github.com/jgm/pandoc) and requires
it to be installed (version 1.14+) along with
[libpandoc](https://github.com/ShabbyX/libpandoc)

Feature wishlist:
- [ ] Markdown Support
- [ ] Embedded LaTeX Support w/ MathJax
- [ ] Site generation like [oredoc](https://github.com/smondet/oredoc)
- [ ] YARD-style function annotation syntax
- [ ] Typing done by [merlin](https://github.com/the-lambda-church/merlin)
